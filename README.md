To start a development server:

`npm start`

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

## Deployment

`npm run build`

It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
